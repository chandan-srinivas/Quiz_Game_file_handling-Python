üí° Future Improvements (Suggestions):
- Randomize questions
  Use import random and random.shuffle() to show questions in different order each time.
- Store high scores
  Save the user's name and high score in a new file like highscores.txt.
- Add difficulty levels
  Separate quiz.txt into levels like easy.txt, medium.txt, hard.txt.
- Use JSON instead of CSV-like format
  Make the file more structured and flexible using JSON.
- GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
  Convert the game to a graphical interface for Windows/Linux apps.
- Online deployment using Streamlit
  Make it web-based and deploy on platforms like Streamlit Cloud or Replit.
